    "# Tutorial 06: Networks from OpenStreetMap\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we discuss how networks that have been imported from OpenStreetMap can be integrated and run in Flow. This will all be presented via the Bay Bridge network, seen in the figure below. Networks from OpenStreetMap are commonly used in many traffic simulators for the purposes of replicating traffic in realistic traffic geometries. This is true in both SUMO and Aimsun (which are both supported in Flow), with each supporting several techniques for importing such network files. This process is further simplified and abstracted in Flow, with users simply required to specify the path to the osm file in order to simulate traffic in the network.\n",

    "\n",
    "While the above example does allow you to view the network within Flow, the simulation is limited for two reasons. For one, vehicles are placed on all edges within the network; if we wished to simulate traffic solely on the on the bridge and do not care about the artireols, for instance, this would result in unnecessary computational burdens. Next, as you may have noticed if you ran the above example to completion, routes in the base network class are defaulted to consist of the vehicles' current edges only, meaning that vehicles exit the network as soon as they reach the end of the edge they are originated on. In the next subsections, we discuss how the network can be modified to resolve these issues.\n",

This variable specifies the names of the edges within the network that vehicles are permitted to originated in, and is assigned to the network via the `edges_distribution` component of the `InitialConfig` input parameter, as seen in the code snippet below. Note that the names of the edges can be identified from the .osm file or by right clicking on specific edges from the SUMO gui (see the figure below).\n",
